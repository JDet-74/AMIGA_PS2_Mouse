# AMIGA_PS2_Mouse
Use a PS/2 mouse with an Amiga computer. <br> There are two versions (DIP-18 and SOIC-18) in this repository. <br>

You can only use mice that are supporting the PS2 protocol. There are some few PS/2 optical mice (USB Type) available. <br>
I got this LOGITECH mouse that works well. <br>

# The story began ...
I bought a used Commodore AMIGA500 ... but ... there was no mouse that I could use. <br> For some reason, there are used AMIGA mice for too much money out there in the market.
So I searched for a better alternative solution an found the webpage of <strong>Henryk Richter</strong> <a href="http://bax.comlab.uni-rostock.de/en/hardware/ps2-amiga-maus/" target="_blank"> Henryks Webpage </a>. Special thanks to Henryk. <br>
I modified his schematic to this version and added a mini-DIN and USB connector to the PCB. <br>
After I milled a prototype PCB I realized, that the HEX-file I got from his webpage do not work. I had no FUSEBIT information and that was the reason.
I contacted Henryk and he sent me his old PIC16F628A MCU so that I could salvage the program with a TL866 programmer.
<p>Take a look into the <a href="Schematic_AMIGA_USB_Mouse_V1_DIP.pdf" target="_blank"> DIP-SCHEMATIC</a> or into the 
    <a href="Schematic_AMIGA_USB_Mouse_V1_SOIC.pdf" target="_blank"> SOIC-SCHEMATIC </a>for further information.</p>

# Fabrication files
You can find a panelized GERBER file version and a single file version. <br>
The panelized version should work for the most PCB manufacturer.
I ordered by JLCPCB.
